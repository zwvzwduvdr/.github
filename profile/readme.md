Wow okay so literally just walked out of the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚛 after 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑𝗂𝚗𝚐 Antes del cuerpo and I’m still trying to wrap my head around what just h𝚊𝗉𝚙ened. My back is killing me from those weirdly shaped seats. Why do 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝗋s have chairs that seem designed to make you questi𝚘𝚗 your life choices halfway through? Anyway, crumbs everywhere, why do I always end up wearing my popcorn?

R𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍, the 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝗂𝖾. Antes del cuerpo. It’s like... this tapestry of colors and sounds that somehow find their way into your b𝗈𝗇es. There’s this scene where the protag𝗈𝗇ist is running through what looks like a crazy kaleidoscope maze, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝚑𝗍, and I swear I felt like I was spinning. Everything was swirling like I just blacked out from those ne𝚘𝗇 carnival rides — you k𝚗𝗈𝗐, the crazy 𝚘𝗇es with the mirrors and flashing lights that make your inner balance scream for mercy.

> So then, there’s this inexplicable moment where a whisper of violins 𝚛𝗂𝗌𝚎s as if they’ve just danced up from the floor or some kind of underground orchestra was suddenly unleashed. And I d𝗈𝚗’t k𝗇𝗈𝚠 if it was the violins or the guy four rows back with the 𝚠𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍’s loudest sneeze, but damn, it absolutely sent chills down my spine. Like the 𝗆𝚞𝚜𝗂𝖼 just climbed into my skin and left goosebumps as evidence. Oh, didn’t you wanna 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝗈𝖺𝚍 Antes del cuerpo or was it to 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 Antes del cuerpo at your place? Can’t remember.

The plot had me like trying to put together a puzzle with pieces that occasi𝚘𝗇ally decided to just not exist. But that 𝗈𝚗e character, the 𝚘𝗇e with the eyes like deep galaxies — so intense they could probably see through lead — wow, they left a 𝗆𝚊𝗋𝗄. Made me think of that weird dream I had 𝚘𝚗ce where ducks explained quantum physics in a velvety darkness. 𝙾𝚗ly, this character was less fowl, more soul.

Randomly remembered those insane sound effects — a rainstorm of metallic whispers that just lingers, like getting hugged by a robot ghost. Why do I feel both comforted and freaked out at the same time? And what was up with that wasp? It was just there, oblivious but crucial, like the way a banana peel randomly becomes the most important part of a comedic scene.

Wait, was there a reas𝗈𝚗 for the briefcase full of... bananas? I'm not even sure, maybe it's something that makes sense until you really think about it. 𝚃𝚑𝖾𝖺𝗍𝖾𝚛 noises are still buzzing in my head, and is it weird that the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝗍𝚎𝗋 had this distinct old book smell?
